                    <h4 class="description">I absorb information and learn concepts quickly. During my time learning to code I've maintained a drive to learn independently and use the many online resources available to solve problems and understand new concepts. This has allowed me to pick up HTML, CSS and JavaScript quickly and apply what I learned to projects that I have produced on my Github profile. I initially found version control difficult to grasp but after sifting through various resources I found a course which allowed me to pick up VC and have been using it on a daily basis.

                    <h4 class="description">I would consider one my main strengths my ability to problem solve in high pressure situations. 
                        In one instance I was put in a position where I was in charge of international shipments for a major interior design company based in high street Kensington, London. I was liaising with multiple logistic organisations to arrange palatalisation of furniture and artwork and arrange for them to be delivered to counties overseas. This involved good time keeping as this would need to be planned strategically and had to meet tight deadlines. Also timezones were a thing I had to consider so I worked around the clock to make sure that my projects were going accordingly to plan.
                        This is where I developed one of my favourite strengths of mine which was my ability to communicate effectively. </h4>
